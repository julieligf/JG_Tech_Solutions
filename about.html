          Tech doesn’t have to be overwhelming. We’re here to make it simple.
        </p>

        <p>
          JG Tech Solutions was created to serve small business owners who are incredible at what they do — but tired of
          fighting with their technology.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          With experience in technical support, cloud tools, CRM systems and workflow design, we focus on building
          clean, reliable setups that match the way <em>you</em> actually work.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          We love working with local New Hampshire businesses: contractors, cleaning companies, real estate professionals,
          gyms and coaches, beauty &amp; wellness providers, and growing online service businesses.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          Our approach is simple: fast responses, clear communication and friendly support — so you always know what’s
          happening and why.
